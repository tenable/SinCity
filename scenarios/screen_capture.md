# Screen Capture Scenario

Tags: T1113

## Description

Adversaries may use screen capture functionality to take pictures of the desktop, which could include open windows and the contents of those windows. This can be used to gather information about what is on the user's screen and potentially sensitive information that is being viewed on the screen.

## Implementation

This scenario will create a new user called "kabiler_jake" on the main_workstation. The user will have a description and a password of s3#fds1 and will be added to the Administrators group.
