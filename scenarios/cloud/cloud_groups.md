# Cloud Groups Scenario

**Tags:** None

## Description

Adversaries may attempt to find cloud groups and permission settings. The knowledge of cloud permission groups can help adversaries determine the particular roles of users and groups within an environment, as well as which users are associated with a particular group.

## Implementation

This scenario will create `sincity_simple_user` under under a new group called `sincity_simple_group`.
