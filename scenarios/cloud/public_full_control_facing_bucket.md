# Public Full Control Facing Bucket Scenario

**Tags:** None

## Description

Adversaries may exfiltrate data by transferring the data, including backups of cloud environments, to another cloud account they control on the same service to avoid typical file transfers/downloads and network-based exfiltration detection.

## Implementation

This scenario will create a full-control S3 bucket which is also public facing.
