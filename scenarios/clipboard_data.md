# Clipboard Data Scenario

**Tags:** T1115

## Description

Adversaries may use the clipboard to copy data from one location and paste it into another location. This can be used to copy data from a source and paste it into a target location on the same system, or it can be used to copy data from a system and paste it onto a remote system.

## Implementation

This scenario will create a new user called "kabiler_jake" on the `main_workstation`. The user will have a description and a password of `s3#fds1` and will be added to the `Administrators` group.
