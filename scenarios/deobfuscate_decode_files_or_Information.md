# Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information Scenario

**Tags:** T1140

## Description

Adversaries may use Obfuscated Files or Information to hide artifacts of an intrusion from analysis. They may require separate mechanisms to decode or deobfuscate that information depending on how they intend to use it. Methods for doing that include built-in functionality of malware or by using utilities present on the system.

## Implementation

No scenario is provided in this configuration file. The `main_workstation` is not mentioned and it's not clear how the deobfuscation or decoding techniques will be applied.
