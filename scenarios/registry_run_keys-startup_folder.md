# Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder Scenario

Tags: T1547.001

## Description

Adversaries may use registry run keys or the startup folder to execute their tools on system startup. This can be done by adding an entry to the "run keys" in the Registry or to the Startup folder. The run keys are used to launch programs automatically when a user logs in or when the system boots. The Startup folder contains shortcuts to programs that run when the user logs in.

## Implementation

There is no implementation for this scenario.
