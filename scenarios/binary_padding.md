# Binary Padding Scenario

**Tags:** T1027.001

## Description

Adversaries may use binary padding to evade detection by inserting data into a binary file that does not affect the functionality of the file. This can be done to make the file size appear normal or to make it more difficult to detect the presence of malicious code.

## Implementation

This scenario will create a new user called "jake_jill" on the `main_workstation`. The user will have a description and a password of `dsa@d2#zs`.
